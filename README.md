# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a Python-based password generator that creates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It allows customization of the password length and the number of numerical digits, special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters to ensure the generated password meets various security requirements.

## Features

- Generate a random, secure password of a specified length.
- Customize the number of numerical digits, special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters in the password.
- Utilizes the `secrets` module for generating cryptographically strong random numbers.

## How to Use

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Call the `generate_password` function with your desired parameters:
   - `length`: Total length of the password (default is 16).
   - `nums`: Minimum number of numerical digits in the password (default is 1).
   - `special_chars`: Minimum number of special characters in the password (default is 1).
   - `uppercase`: Minimum number of uppercase letters in the password (default is 1).
   - `lowercase`: Minimum number of lowercase letters in the password (default is 1).

Example:
```python
new_password = generate_password(length=20, nums=2, special_chars=2, uppercase=2, lowercase=2)
print('Generated password:', new_password)
```

## Technical Details

- The script uses the `string` module to access a collection of string constants for letters, digits, and symbols.
- The `secrets` module is utilized to provide a secure source of random numbers, enhancing the security of the generated password.
- The password is validated to ensure it meets the specified constraints before being returned to the user.

## Setup and Installation

No additional installation is required beyond a Python interpreter. Simply download the script and run it in your Python environment.
